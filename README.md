# INF1002 Stock Market Analysis Project 
This project will analyze stock market price data to identify trends and compute trading metrics. Users will be able to view simple moving averages (SMA), detect upward and downward streaks, calculate daily returns, and simulate maximum profit strategies. Data visualization will be included for better interpretation of results.
